# Decacrypt 

Decacrypt is an RSA encryption application written in C# which can generate RSA keys as well as encrypt and decrypt strings and values. It supports configuration of bases for all parts of the key, as well as the plaintext and ciphertext.

In the future I plan to add support for other encryption standards.
